## 10 Domains, 20 Rival States

Note: Example hypotheses below are illustrative. For actual validated hypotheses from engine runs, see [atlantiskb.com](https://atlantiskb.com).

Atlantis operates across 10 research domains, each with two rival States representing opposing epistemological approaches. This structure ensures productive tension and prevents intellectual monoculture.

## 1. Mathematics

**Domain Type:** Formal
**Anchor Type:** SymPy symbolic computation

**Rival Approaches:**
- **Mathematics_Alpha (Formalist):** Knowledge derives from axioms, proofs, and pure logical structure. Emphasizes rigor, consistency, and formal systems.
- **Mathematics_Beta (Applied):** Knowledge serves real-world modeling, computation, and problem-solving. Emphasizes practical utility and numerical methods.

**What the Anchor Checks:**
- Derivative correctness (`d/dx(x²) = 2x`, not `3x`)
- Arithmetic errors (`2+2 = 5` flagged)
- Algebraic simplification mistakes
- Integration errors

**Example Hypothesis (Formalist Approach):**
> The Riemann Hypothesis's resolution requires extending Zeta function analysis beyond classical complex analysis into non-standard number systems, specifically using p-adic completions to capture zero-distribution patterns invisible in standard complex plane topology.

**Example Hypothesis (Applied Approach):**
> Numerical eigenvalue algorithms for sparse matrices converge faster using adaptive preconditioning based on graph Laplacian structure rather than static incomplete LU factorization, reducing computational cost from O(n³) to O(n log n) for real-world network problems.

## 2. Physics

**Domain Type:** Empirical
**Anchor Type:** Dimensional analysis + physical constants

**Rival Approaches:**
- **Physics_Alpha (Theoretical):** Knowledge advances through equations, mathematical predictions, and unification of fundamental forces.
- **Physics_Beta (Experimental):** Knowledge derives from observation, measurement, falsification, and data-driven validation of theories.

**What the Anchor Checks:**
- Speeds > speed of light (unless subject IS light/photons)
- Temperatures < absolute zero
- Wrong physical constants (Planck, Boltzmann, G)
- Dimensional inconsistencies (adding meters to seconds)

**Example Hypothesis (Theoretical Approach):**
> Dark energy's acceleration can be explained through emergent spacetime rather than cosmological constant by modeling vacuum as a quantum error-correcting code where entanglement entropy gradients produce effective repulsive force at cosmic scales.

**Example Hypothesis (Experimental Approach):**
> Neutrino oscillation measurements at different baselines (300km vs 810km) show flavor-mixing probabilities inconsistent with three-generation model, suggesting sterile neutrino existence measurable through disappearance channel experiments at intermediate energies (1-10 GeV).

## 3. Biology

**Domain Type:** Empirical
**Anchor Type:** Established biological facts

**Rival Approaches:**
- **Biology_Alpha (Molecular):** Understanding life through genes, proteins, cellular mechanisms, and biochemical pathways.
- **Biology_Beta (Systems):** Understanding life through ecosystems, evolution, emergent behavior, and organism-environment interactions.

**What the Anchor Checks:**

- Lamarckian inheritance claims (inheritance of acquired traits)
- Prokaryotes with nuclei
- Mitochondria in prokaryotes

**Example Hypothesis (Molecular Approach):**
> DNA polymerase error rates in multicellular eukaryotes are maintained within 10⁻⁹ to 10⁻¹⁰ per base pair not solely for minimizing mutation accumulation, but because this rate optimizes evolvability by preserving adaptive mutation capacity in germline cells while preventing somatic cancer.

**Example Hypothesis (Systems Approach):**
> Ecosystem collapse follows predictable tipping-point dynamics where biodiversity loss below 30% of baseline triggers cascading extinctions through mutualistic network fragmentation, measurable as sudden drops in functional redundancy across trophic levels within 5-10 year windows.

## 4. Finance

**Domain Type:** Applied
**Anchor Type:** Financial logic + probability constraints

**Rival Approaches:**
- **Finance_Alpha (Quantitative):** Markets governed by algorithms, risk models, statistical arbitrage, and mathematical optimization.
- **Finance_Beta (Behavioral):** Markets driven by psychology, sentiment cycles, cognitive biases, and irrational actors.

- P = NP claims (unproven, flag as speculative)
- Halting problem violations
- O(1) sorting claims
- Impossible complexity class reductions

**Example Hypothesis (Architecture Approach):**
> Microservices communication overhead dominates latency budgets beyond 50-service deployments; event-driven architectures with CQRS reduce inter-service calls by 80% through eventual consistency, trading strong consistency for 10x throughput gains in write-heavy workloads.

**Example Hypothesis (AI Approach):**
> Transformer models trained on code repositories develop emergent algorithmic reasoning beyond pattern matching, evidenced by zero-shot solutions to novel LeetCode problems requiring multi-step planning, suggesting composition of learned primitives rather than memorization.

---

## 6. Medicine

**Domain Type:** Empirical
**Anchor Type:** Clinical standards + debunked claims

**Rival Approaches:**
- **Medicine_Alpha (Clinical):** Health improved through treatments, randomized trials, patient outcomes, and evidence-based interventions.
- **Medicine_Beta (Preventive):** Health improved through public health policy, epidemiology, population-level interventions, and disease prevention.

**What the Anchor Checks:**
- Vaccines → autism link (debunked)
- Correlation → causation jumps without RCT evidence
- Unverified treatment efficacy claims

**Example Hypothesis (Clinical Approach):**
> Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy produces 5-year survival rates exceeding 40% in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer when PD-L1 expression exceeds 50%, representing a 3x improvement over chemotherapy alone, measurable through progression-free survival endpoints.

**Example Hypothesis (Preventive Approach):**
> Sugar-sweetened beverage taxation at $0.02/oz reduces childhood obesity rates by 8-12% within 3 years through both consumption reduction and reformulation incentives, with effects concentrated in low-income urban populations (elasticity: -1.4).

## 7. Geography

**Domain Type:** Empirical
**Anchor Type:** Physical constants + demographics

**Rival Approaches:**
- **Geography_Alpha (Physical):** Spatial patterns explained by climate systems, geological processes, natural resources, and environmental factors.
- **Geography_Beta (Human):** Spatial patterns explained by demographics, urbanization, migration, and human-environment interactions.

**What the Anchor Checks:**
- Earth radius/circumference errors
- Population orders of magnitude (e.g., claiming 70 billion people)
- Continental drift rates

**Example Hypothesis (Physical Approach):**
> Arctic permafrost thaw accelerates methane release through taliks (unfrozen zones) that allow deeper carbon pool access, producing runaway warming feedback when soil temperatures exceed -2°C for sustained periods, measurable through eddy covariance flux towers showing 300% emission increases at threshold crossings.

**Example Hypothesis (Human Approach):**
> Urban heat island intensity (ΔT between city center and rural surroundings) correlates with impervious surface percentage following power law (ΔT ∝ ISP^0.7), explaining why cities above 60% impervious cover experience 5-8°C temperature differentials independent of climate zone or latitude.

## 8. History

**Domain Type:** Interpretive
**Anchor Type:** Chronology + date verification

**Rival Approaches:**
- **History_Alpha (Analytical):** Past understood through patterns, causation, structural cycles, and quantitative analysis of long-term trends.
- **History_Beta (Narrative):** Past understood through culture, identity, collective memory, and contextualized human experiences.

**What the Anchor Checks:**
- Anachronisms (ancient Rome with guns)
- Wrong dates (French Revolution in 1889 instead of 1789)
- Impossible causation chains (effect before cause)

**Example Hypothesis (Analytical Approach):**
> Imperial collapse follows predictable 200-250 year cycles driven by fiscal overextension (military costs exceeding 40% GDP), elite fragmentation (Gini coefficient >0.6), and frontier defense failure, evidenced by consistent patterns across Roman, Ottoman, and Qing empires.

**Example Hypothesis (Narrative Approach):**
> National identity formation during 19th-century state-building required constructed "shared pasts" more than actual historical continuity, explaining why French Revolutionary narrative erased regional identities (Breton, Occitan) through centralized education mandates 1880-1914 despite linguistic diversity persisting in census data.

## 9. Economics

**Domain Type:** Social Science
**Anchor Type:** Accounting identities

**Rival Approaches:**
- **Economics_Alpha (Macroeconomics):** Economies governed by policy, trade systems, monetary theory, and aggregate indicators.
- **Economics_Beta (Microeconomics):** Economies emerge from individual incentives, market behavior, game theory, and rational choice.

**What the Anchor Checks:**
- GDP components summing >100%
- Impossible sustained growth claims (10% GDP growth for 100 years)
- Budget constraint violations

**Example Hypothesis (Macro Approach):**
> Central bank forward guidance effectiveness depends on credibility stock measured through historical forecast accuracy; when RMSE of 2-year inflation forecasts exceeds 1.5%, guidance loses market-moving power, explaining 2008-2015 QE transmission weakness despite unprecedented balance sheet expansion.

**Example Hypothesis (Micro Approach):**
> Uber/Lyft surge pricing follows dynamic game theory with drivers responding to price signals in 8-12 minute cycles, producing Nash equilibrium where surge multiplier equals marginal driver's reservation wage divided by base fare, measurable through GPS positioning data during demand spikes.

## 10. Philosophy

**Domain Type:** Philosophical
**Anchor Type:** Formal logic

**Rival Approaches:**
- **Philosophy_Alpha (Empiricism):** Knowledge derives from sensory evidence, logical analysis, scientific method, and verifiable observation.
- **Philosophy_Beta (Rationalism):** Knowledge derives from reason, innate principles, ethics, meaning, and the nature of consciousness.

**What the Anchor Checks:**
- Affirming the consequent (If P→Q and Q, then P)
- False dilemmas (Only A or B when C exists)
- Naturalistic fallacy (Is → Ought)

**Example Hypothesis (Empiricist Approach):**
> Consciousness emerges from integrated information processing measurable through perturbational complexity index (PCI), where PCI >0.5 reliably distinguishes conscious from unconscious brain states, suggesting phenomenal experience supervenes on functional complexity rather than substrate.

**Example Hypothesis (Rationalist Approach):**
> Mathematical truths exist independently of physical instantiation, evidenced by their necessity (2+2=4 in all possible worlds), universality (discovered not invented), and applicability to empirical phenomena despite abstract derivation, suggesting Platonist realism over nominalist conventionalism.
